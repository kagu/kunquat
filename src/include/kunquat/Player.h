/**
 * \defgroup Player Playing Kunquat compositions
 *
 * \{
 *
 * \brief
 * This module describes a simple API for applications that use libkunquat
 * for playing Kunquat compositions.
 *
 * After the Kunquat Handle has been created, the user can get the audio to
 * be played in short sections. First the user renders a short section of music
 * into an internal buffer and then transfers the necessary information from
 * the internal buffer into their own output buffer. This process is repeated
 * as many times as needed.
 *
 * The audio output is organised in two interleaved areas in a single buffer,
 * which should be compatible with most common audio programming interfaces.
 * This means that the total amount of floating-point numbers in the returned
 * buffer is kqt_Handle_get_frames_available(handle) * 2.
 *
 * The basic playback cycle might look like this:
 *
 * \code
 * long buffer_size = kqt_Handle_get_audio_buffer_size(handle);
 * kqt_Handle_play(handle);
 * while (!kqt_Handle_has_stopped(handle))
 * {
 *     long frames_available = kqt_Handle_get_frames_available(handle);
 *     float* buffer = kqt_Handle_get_audio(handle);
 *
 *     // Send buffer contents to the audio interface
 *
 *     kqt_Handle_play(handle);
 * }
 * \endcode
